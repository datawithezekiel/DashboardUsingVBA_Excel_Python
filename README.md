AIC Co. Sales Analytics Dashboard


Hey there! 

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the AIC Co. Sales Analytics Dashboard project. This README will walk you through what this dashboard is all about and how it can help transform raw sales data into actionable insights.
What's This All About?
I'm Ezekiel Ebuetse, and I've built this dashboard to help make sense of AIC Co.'s sales performance over 2023-2024. Instead of drowning in spreadsheets and numbers, this dashboard gives you a clear picture of what's working, what's not, and where the opportunities are hiding.
The Story Behind the Numbers
This dashboard tells the story of AIC Co.'s Â£3,054,204 in sales and how that translates to about Â£931,585 in margin (that's a healthy 30.5% average margin!). But beyond the big numbers, it's about understanding our 480 customers â€“ both the 182 newcomers and our 298 loyal repeat customers.
What You'll Discover
When you dive into this dashboard, you'll be able to:

Track how sales have ebbed and flowed throughout the year
See which UAE cities are our strongest markets (and which need some love)
Compare how different service offerings stack up (SEO, Web Dev, Ads, App Dev, Social Media)
Discover which customer acquisition channels are bringing in the most value (Ads, Organic, Walk-in)
Understand department performance and how each contributes to our success

Getting Started Is Easy

Open them up in [your preferred software]
Play around with the filters to explore different angles

The Tech Stuff
You'll need [appropriate software] to run this dashboard. Don't worry â€“ I've kept it simple and user-friendly. No programming required!
How This Helps AIC Co.
This isn't just a pretty visualization â€“ it's a decision-making tool designed to help:

Figure out where to focus our marketing efforts
Keep more customers coming back
Double down on our most profitable services
Make smarter decisions about where to expand
Allocate our resources where they'll make the biggest impact

What's Next?
I'm constantly working to make this dashboard even better. On my roadmap:

Making it update in real-time
Adding predictive features so we can see what's coming
Digging deeper into customer lifetime value
Making the visuals even more intuitive and insightful
